# :compass: Compass

_Reinvent your file system_

> STATUS: Compass is currently under pre-alpha initial development, and we cannot guarantee anything works at the moment.

The reign of mouse-less file management ended with [midnight commander](https://midnight-commander.org/). compass aims to reinvent that philosophy.

Built with [`gpui`](https://www.gpui.rs/) in Rust, with a powerful [`go`](https://go.dev/) based scripting system, your work, terminal, cloud solutions, and more are just a query away.

Navigate through your files at the speed of light, while maintaining full control over your system. No hidden files. No hidden features.

### Open Source

Compass is fully open source under the GNU GPLv3 License, with contribution guidelines coming soon as development kicks off.

Have a suggestion? Open an [issue](https://github.com/abhi-arya1/compass/issues) and we'll get to it ASAP!
